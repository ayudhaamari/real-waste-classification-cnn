        Manual waste sorting is inefficient, leading to low recycling rates and increased environmental harm.

        This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of accurately classifying waste images into nine distinct material types:
        1. Cardboard - e.g., boxes, packaging
        2. Glass - e.g., bottles, jars
        3. Metal - e.g., cans, foil
        4. Paper - e.g., newspapers, magazines
        5. Plastic - e.g., bottles, containers
        6. Miscellaneous Trash - e.g., non-recyclable items
        7. Food Organics - e.g., fruit peels, vegetable scraps
        8. Textile Trash - e.g., old clothes, fabrics
        9. Vegetation - e.g., leaves, branches

        By leveraging deep learning techniques, we seek to automate and improve waste management efficiency, ultimately contributing to environmental sustainability. Our model will analyze visual characteristics such as shape, color, and texture to categorize waste items, helping to streamline recycling processes and reduce the environmental impact of improper waste disposal.

        The successful implementation of this project could lead to:
        - Increased recycling rates
        - Reduced contamination in recycling streams
        - Lower operational costs for waste management facilities
        - Enhanced public awareness about proper waste sorting
