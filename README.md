## 🧠 The Brain Behind the Magic: InceptionV3

This project leverages the powerful **InceptionV3** architecture, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network designed for both efficiency and performance.

### 🏗️ Architecture Overview

InceptionV3 is approximately **48 layers** deep and is composed of various building blocks, including:

- **Convolutions**
- **Max Pooling and Average Pooling**
- **Dropouts**
- **Fully Connected Layers**

![InceptionV3 Architecture](images/inceptionv3_architecture.png)
*Diagram of the InceptionV3 architecture.*

### 🔍 Inception Modules

- **Parallel Convolutions**: Processes input data through multiple convolutional layers with different filter sizes (1x1, 3x3, 5x5) simultaneously, capturing features at various scales.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Uses 1x1 convolutions to reduce the number of feature maps, decreasing computational cost without losing information.

### 🏋️ Efficient Computing

- **Factorized Convolutions**: Breaks down larger convolutions into smaller, more efficient operations (e.g., a 5x5 convolution into two 3x3 convolutions).
- **Asymmetric Convolutions**: Uses combinations like 1x7 followed by 7x1 convolutions to replace a single 7x7 convolution, further reducing computation.

### 🌐 Auxiliary Classifiers

- **Improved Gradient Flow**: Incorporates auxiliary classifiers connected to intermediate layers to help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.
- **Regularization**: Acts as an additional form of regularization during training, improving generalization.

### 📊 Parameters

- **Manageable Size**: Approximately **23.9 million parameters**, striking a balance between complexity and computational efficiency.
- **Fine-Tuning**: We fine-tuned the pre-trained InceptionV3 model on our waste classification dataset to enhance performance.

### 🔧 Customization for Waste Classification

- **Modified Output Layer**: Adjusted the final dense layer to output predictions for **9 classes** corresponding to the waste categories.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied transformations such as rotation, flipping, zooming, and brightness adjustment to increase dataset variability.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Employed the **Adam** optimizer and **categorical cross-entropy** loss function for efficient training.
